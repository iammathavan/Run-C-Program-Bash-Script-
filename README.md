# Run-C-Program-Bash-Script-
Just a simple Bash Script to run C programs. Instead of compiling and running the C programs each time, I made a simple Bash Script to take care of it. By just calling ./script file1.c file2.c in the terminal will compile both the C files and run the created executable file.
