# Run-C-Program-Bash-Script-
Just a simple Bash Script to run a C programs. Instead of each time compiling and running the C programs, I made a simple Bash Script that will take of it. Just calling ./script file1.c file2.c in the terminal will, compile both the C files and run the produced executable file too.
